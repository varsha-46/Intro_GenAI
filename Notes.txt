Basically, GenAI uses the Foundational models which means it can solve a coding question, rephrases the sentences, logical query etc. Previous ML models used works on single task only like prediction and classify etc. 
When it comes to GENAI it has huge architecture and lot of parameters need lot of GPU for training(similarly it has whole internet data). Foundational models are LLM, Large Multi-Models. 
When comes to builder's perspective we have to learn:
-->Transformers Architecture
-->Encoder-Only(BERT), Decoder-Only(GPT) and Encoder-decoder(T5).
-->Pre Training
-->Optimization
-->Fine Tuning
-->Evaluation 
-->Deployment
When comes to User's perspective:
-->Building LLMs and making it use using Huggingface Transformers, Ollama, Open/Closed source API etc
-->Prompt Engineering
-->RAG
-->Fine Tuning
-->Agents
-->LLMOps

LangChain:
It is Open-source framework that helps in building LLM based applications. provides modular componennts and end-to-end tools that help developer to build complex AI applications such as chatbots, qna syst ems, RAG, autonomous agents etc.
>Supports all major LLMs, simiply developing LLM based applications, integration available, opensource/free, supports all major GenAI use cases.

***LangChain***
Open-source framework for developing applications powered by LLMs.
